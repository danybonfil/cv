**PhD Candidate in Administration**, Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV EBAPE)

I am a PhD Candidate in Administration at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV EBAPE), where I examine the limitations of economic voting as a mechanism of democratic accountability. My dissertation explores how affective biases and macroeconomic perceptions shape political behavior in the U.S., Mexico, and OECD countries. Through a series of essays, I analyze the influence of affect on economic retrospection in U.S. politics, the role of exogenous U.S. labor market conditions in shaping presidential success in Mexico, and the impact of affective polarization on the assignment of responsibility for the economy in advanced democracies. My research tests the extent to which voters can effectively hold governments accountable through economic voting in different political and economic contexts.

My academic interests are grounded in prior experience in both the public and private sectors. I served as a capital markets analyst at Mexico’s Ministry of Finance, a research analyst in fintech and digital payments at Grupo Carso, and later as FP&A Manager at Leisure Partners, where I supported financial modeling and tourism asset strategy. With a background in Economics (MSc, Peking University) and Financial Management (BA, Tec de Monterrey), I apply an interdisciplinary perspective to my research, combining quantitative methods with observational studies and survey experiments. At FGV, I have also served as a teaching assistant for “Statistics 0” and “AI for Business and Public Administration Research.”
