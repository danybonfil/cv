I am a PhD Candidate in Administration at FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas (FGV EBAPE), where I study the limits of economic voting as a mechanism of democratic accountability. My dissertation examines how affective biases and macroeconomic perceptions shape political behavior across the U.S., Mexico, and OECD countries.

My research includes:
- The role of affect in economic retrospection in U.S. politics
- The influence of exogenous U.S. labor market conditions on presidential success in Mexico
- How affective polarization affects attribution of economic responsibility in advanced democracies

These essays explore whether and how voters hold governments accountable under varying political and economic contexts.

My academic work is informed by professional experience in both public and private sectors. I have served as:
- Capital Markets Analyst at Mexicoâ€™s Ministry of Finance
- Research Analyst in fintech/digital payments at Grupo Carso
- FP&A Manager at Leisure Partners

I hold an MSc in Economics from Peking University and a BA in Financial Management from Tec de Monterrey. I combine quantitative methods, observational data, and survey experiments in my research. At FGV, I have assisted courses in statistics and AI for public policy research.
